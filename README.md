# SHAPEAI DATA ANALYTICS AND DASHBOARDS WITH EXCEL BOOTCAMP
Hi I made this project during the 7 Days Free Bootcamp, conducted by <b> SHAPEAI
</b>.
The instructor during the session was Mr Dipayan Ghoshal  (EX-Intern at Amazon ). I got to
learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with SHAPEAI.
<br><br>Here's the link for you to watch the sessions as well<br>

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li> INTRO TO EXCEL AND FORMULAS
<li>INTRODUCTION TO DATA VISUALISATION
<li>FOUNDATIONAL KNOWLEDGE IN DATA DASHBOARD
<br>during these 7 days, and everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
I enjoyed these 7 days, you can as well. To register for next free 7 days bootcamp, visit:
